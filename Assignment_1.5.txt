1. Explain hadoop in layman's term

*Hadoop is a complete ecosystem of open source software that provoed the framework to deal with large amount of data ie Big Data.
*There are two most important parts of Hadoop components. 
*The storage part is known as Hadoop Distributed File Systems, which is designed to span large clusters of commodity servers.
*The other part is the processing part which is known as MapReduce.
*MapReduce which splits the input data into independent chunks which are then processed by the map tasks in a parallel manner.
*Hive is used for processing the structured  data whereas Pig is used for processing the unstructured data.

2. Explain the components of Hadoop framework

*HDFS           - Hadoop Distributed File System
                         The storage layer of the Hadoop Framework.
*MapReduce  - The processing component of the Hadoop Framework which splits the input data and processed by map tasks in parallel manner.
                         The Reducer gathers the results and resolves into a single value.
*YARN            - Yet Another Resource Negotiator
                         It is the cluster management layer of the Hadoop framework.
                         With YARN you can run multiple applications in Hadoop.
*Spark           - Used on top of the HDFS. Faster than the MapReduce function.
                          Allows data to load into memory.
*Hive             -  It is a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop.
*HBase          -  Its is a NoSQL columnar database which is designed to run on top of HDFS.
*Flume           -  Collects data from agents which it then aggregates and moves into Hadoop.
*Mahout        -  It is a machine learning library. It collects key algorithms for clustering, classification collaborative filtering and implements them on top of
                         distributed data systems.
*Sqoop          -  It is a tool which aids in transitioning data from other databases into Hadoop.

3. Explain the reasons to learn Big data technologies

*It brings in the better career opportunities.
*We can pace up with the exponentially growing big data market as well as new technologies emerging along with it.
*Demands for Big Data skills is extremely high.
